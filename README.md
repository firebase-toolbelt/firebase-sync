# firebase-sync

Bind your firebase backend to your redux state with a dead simple component based approach.
We also provide a lot of utilities making this lib extremelly flexible for your app's needs.
This has been used for more than one year in production apps.

## Setting up

First you must add the firebase-sync reducer to your app's reducers.

```javascript
  import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
  import { getFirebaseSyncReducer } from 'firebase-react-redux';
  
  combineReducers({
    // ...your other reducers go here
    firebase: getFirebaseSyncReducer()
  })
```

Then you would normally setup the firebase-sync component, selector and map state util.
These will then be used throughout your app.

```javascript
// ./lib/FirebaseSync.js

import store from './my-redux-store';
import firebase from '/my-initialized-firebase-app';
import buildFirebaseSync from 'firebase-sync';

// the reducer name you have used in your root reducer.
const reducerName = 'firebase';

const {
  FirebaseSync,
  firebaseSyncConnect
} = buildFirebaseSync({ firebase, store, basePath: reducerName });

export { FirebaseSync, firebaseSyncConnect };
```

## Setting up with Immutable.js

(If you're not using Immutable.js you can skip to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) guide.

First you must add the firebase-sync reducer to your app's reducers.
You must pass in a `Map` object so we can use it as the reducer's initial state.

```javascript
  import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
  import { getFirebaseSyncReducer } from 'firebase-react-redux';
  import { Map } from 'immutable';
  
  combineReducers({
    // ...your other reducers go here
    firebase: getFirebaseSyncReducer(Map())
  })
```

Then you would normally setup the firebase-sync component and selector.
These components will then be used throughout your app.
Since you're using Immutable.js you must pass in a `onPostProcessItem` function to the component defaultProps.
This way everything is saved as an Immutable object on your app's state.

```javascript
// ./lib/FirebaseSync.js

import store from './my-redux-store';
import firebase from '/my-initialized-firebase-app';
import buildFirebaseSync from 'firebase-sync';

import { fromJS } from 'immutable';

// the reducer name you have used in your root reducer.
const reducerName = 'firebase';

const {
  FirebaseSync,
  firebaseSyncConnect
} = buildFirebaseSync({
  firebase,
  store,
  basePath: reducerName,
  defaultProps: {
    onPostProcessItem: fromJS
  }
});

export { FirebaseSync, firebaseSyncConnect };
```

##  Your first synced component

We will build a simple user profile component that syncs the user object from your firebase database.
There are two things that you should notice:
- we're using the absence of the user object on our state to show our loading state.
- our database object key is automatically saved on a special `_key` prop. We provide a *lot* more of this utilities.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { FirebaseSync, firebaseSyncConnect } from '../lib/FirebaseSync'

const User = (props) => (
  <div>
  
    <FirebaseSync path=`users/${props.userId}` />
    
    {(!props.user) ? (
      <p>loadingâ€¦</p>
    ) : (
      <p>
        <h1>User name: {props.user.name}</h1>
        <p>User id: {props.user._key}</h1>
      </p>
    )}
  
  </div>
)

export default firebaseSyncConnect((state, props) => ({
  user: `users/${props.userId}`
})(User)
```
